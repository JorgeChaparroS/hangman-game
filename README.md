# HANGMAN GAME.

This react project brings a random word from the API: https://clientes.api.greenborn.com.ar/public-random-word

Then you can start playing by trying to guess the word that was brought.

Use the key board to type letters. Once one of them is contained in the word, it will be showed on screen.

But be carefull, you have limited chances to guess the word. DonÂ´t let your man die.

Good look.

# Tech Stack.
This project was built using React.js

# Just so you know:
This application is not responsive. It will only look "good" (I did not put much effort in the UI, the main purpose of this app is to practice some of my programming logic and basic React.js knowlegde) on desktop screens.
